# IGRT margins
The MATLAB algorithm extracts the setup errors in three translational directions (x, y and z) from the data logged by the CBCT system during treatment delivery. The algorithm also calculates the resulted population setup error and PTV margin based on van Herk margin recipe, and subsequently estimates their respective values for No Action Level (NAL) and extended No Action Level (eNAL) offline correction protocols.
